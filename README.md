## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

2. Provide your Groq API key for configuration. You can do this in one of two ways:

- Create a `config.toml` file in the root directory with the following content:

```toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
```

- Or create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

Run the Streamlit app with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the URL provided by Streamlit in your browser to use the app.

## Dependencies

- streamlit
- groq
- Pillow
- gtts

## Notes

- Ensure your API key is kept secure and not hardcoded in the source code.
- The app loads environment variables from `config.toml` if present, otherwise falls back to `.env` file for configuration.
